# a) Install Ghidra.

Ghidra Installed, and working.

# b) rever-C. Reverse engineer the packd binary to C language with Ghidra. Find the main program. Give variables descriptive names. Explain the program's operation.

I think the main program is called FUN_0010578d. The way I got to this solution was by analyzing entry, now entry according to this [source](https://medium.com/@jeanmichel.amblat/first-steps-with-ghidra-crackme01-319827a2e80b)  is where the program starts and usually will lead us to main.

So following the trail, from the Symbol tree I opened "Functions"

* From functions I selected "entry"
* From Entry I saw there are 2 functions, 1 named FUN_00105988 other one, FUN_0010578d.
* This is the compiler view of the 88 ending one

* This was the compiler view of the 578d endint one

* From this I cant really know for sure which one is the main function.

According to another [article](https://medium.com/@greg-chapman/reveng-01-finding-main-in-32cdb8e1e9b5) I should usually find the main function by just filtering it

That did not work for me.

I did go trough every function manually, and I found one that had an undefined method, maybe this is the MAIN program?

I have no idea how to confirm if my assumption here is correct or not, so I leave this one open for now.

# c) If backwards. Modify the passtr program's binary (without the original source code) so that it accepts all passwords except the correct one. Demonstrate with tests that the program works. ezbin-challenges.zip

# d) Nora CrackMe: Compile to binaries Tindall 2023: NoraCodes / crackmes. Read README.md: don't look at the source code unless you need training wheels. In these tasks, binaries are reverse engineered. Binaries are not modified, because otherwise the solution to every task would be to change the return value to "return 0".

# e) Nora crackme01. Solve the binary.

# e) Nora crackme01e. Solve the binary.

# f) Nora crackme02. Name the main program's variables from the reverse-engineered binary and explain the program's operation. Solve the binary.
