# a) Baseline
## 1 Physical Infrastructure

Network Equipment: 
* Home router (ISP-provided, Had a openWRT on my old router but isp did not like it)

Devices:
* Personal laptop
* Phone for wifi at school

Virtualization Environment: 
* Virtual machines (VMs) running on host system for penetration testing, Kali Linux and potential vulnerable systems / labs

Study Materials:
* Course documentation
* Cybersecurity lab instructions

## 2 Scope Exclusion

Other household members devices: 
* Personal phones
* laptops
* tablets
* Gaming consoles
* Employer-managed devices

Justification: I do not own the rights to these devices

Additional: 

* Public Internet

Justification: No ownership

## 3 KEY INTERFACES

Internet: 

Router/Firewall: Primary interface between home network and ISP

* Ingress/egress filtering
* NAT configuration

ISP Connection: point where home network meets provider infrastructure

Cloud Service: 

* GitHub/GitLab: Code repositories, version control, potentially sensitive scripts
* Haaga-Helia LMS: Course materials

Remote Access: No Remote access needed (DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT REALLY NEEDED TO BE DOCUMENTED HERE)

EVIDENCE

Network Infrastructure:

* Screenshot of router admin panel showing connected devices list and basic firewall settings
* Router model and firmware version information

Virtual Lab Environment:

* VM version, what specs does the VM run on
* Screenshot showing installed security tools and active VMs ( in the case of for example metasploit)

Information Assets:

* Directory structure of organized course materials folder
* GitHub repository list showing course-related projects

# B) Tie It to the Standard

## 2 INTERESTED PARTIES

ANDRO (STUDENT)

Need/expectation/requerment: 

* Reliable access to lab environment 
* VMs
* Tools needed to complete coursework

ISO 27001 clause 6:

* Risk assessment
* identifying risks (hardware failure, data loss) and implemeting controls

Evidence: 

* Recovery logs (for example when an VM is recovered)
* Risk register listing threats that are on going / have been

Haaga-Helia 

Need/expectation/requerment: 

* Coursework must be original
* lab exercises conducted ethically
* penetration testing limited to students only

ISO 27001, clause 8:

* Ensuring security testing is authorized and limited to appropriate targets

Evidence:

* Lab documentation showing authorized targets
* Potential Network logs, to audit that the network of Haaga-Helia has not been tempered with
