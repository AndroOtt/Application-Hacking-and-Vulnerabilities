# a) Baseline
## 1 Physical Infrastructure

Network Equipment: 
* Home router (ISP-provided, Had a openWRT on my old router but isp did not like it)

Devices:
* Personal laptop
* Phone for wifi at school

Virtualization Environment: 
* Virtual machines (VMs) running on host system for penetration testing, Kali Linux and potential vulnerable systems / labs

Study Materials:
* Course documentation
* Cybersecurity lab instructions

## 2 Scope Exclusion

Other household members devices: 
* Personal phones
* laptops
* tablets
* Gaming consoles
* Employer-managed devices

Justification: I do not own the rights to these devices

Additional: 

* Public Internet

## 3 KEY INTERFACES

Internet Boundary

Router/Firewall: Primary interface between home network and ISP

* NAT configuration

ISP Connection: point where home network meets provider infrastructure

Cloud Service: 

* GitHub/GitLab: Code repositories, version control, potentially sensitive scripts
* Haaga-Helia LMS: Course materials

Remote Access: No Remote access needed (DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT REALLY NEEDED TO BE DOCUMENTED HERE)

EVIDENCE

Network Infrastructure:

* Screenshot of router admin panel showing connected devices list and basic firewall settings
* Router model and firmware version information

Virtual Lab Environment:

* VM version, what specs does the VM run on
* Screenshot showing installed security tools and active VMs ( in the case of for example metasploit)

Information Assets:

* Directory structure of organized course materials folder
* GitHub repository list showing course-related projects
