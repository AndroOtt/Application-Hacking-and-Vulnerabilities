# x) Read/watch/listen and summarize. (In this x-subsection, you don't need to do tests on a computer; just reading or listening and a summary is enough. A few bullet points are sufficient for the summary.)

## OWASP: OWASP Top 10: A01 Broken Access Control https://owasp.org/Top10/2021/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/index.html

* OWASP Top 10 Broken Access Control defines what broken access control means and the different ways vulnerabilities are found in broken access control
  * For example broken access control is getting access to certain parts of a webpage/database/application that you should not have access to
  * By modying the URL, page HTML, using an attack tool that modifies API requests, Elevation of priviledge (Acting as a user without being logged in) attackers can get into different parts of an application.

## Karvinen 2023: Find Hidden Web Directories - Fuzz URLs with ffuf 
* fuff is a directory fuzzing tool that enables you to probe hidden directories (and even passwords, headers, etc...)
* Essentially what fuff does is that it 

## PortSwigger: Access control vulnerabilities and privilege escalation
* There are 3 distinct type of access control vulnerabilities
  * Vertical access controls
    * Different type of users have access to different application functions (probably the most commonly used).
  * Horizontal access controls
    *  Specific users have access to the same type of resource but will only be able to see their own resource not anyone elses.
  * Context-dependent access controls
    *  Restricts the users access to functions based on what is happening in the application at the current time.

## Karvinen 2006: Report Writing (in Finnish)

* A good report consists of the following things
  * Good documentation of the tasks (I.E screenshots and details of the problems that arise)
  * Computer that is used to execute the tasks
  * What commands are used in the task
  * Good documentation practices
  * Refer to sources and list them 

# a) Break into 010-staff-only. See Karvinen 2024: Hack'n Fix

# b) Fix the 010-staff-only vulnerability from source code. Demonstrate with a test that your solution works.

# c) Solve dirfuzt-1 from the article Karvinen 2023: Find Hidden Web Directories - Fuzz URLs with ffuf. This helps in solving 020-your-eyes-only.

# d) Break into 020-your-eyes-only. See Karvinen 2024: Hack'n Fix

# e) Fix the 020-your-eyes-only vulnerability. Demonstrate with a test that your solution works.
