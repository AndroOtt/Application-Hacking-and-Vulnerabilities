ENVIRONMENT: WSL, UBUNTU 24.04.1 LTS

# a) Strings. Download ezbin-challenges.zip. Run 'passtr'. Find the correct password using 'strings'. Also find the flag. (Preferably without looking at the source, if you can.)

1. Downloaded the ZIP file
2. Read the README.md file
   * In the readme there were instructions on how to run the code.
   * First I ran the code with ./passtr, it then asked me to input a password.

   * After Inputting a password, the program responded with Sorry, no bonus.

3. Now here I did not understand what "strings" meant, so I decided to look around. It turned out that strings is a tool that is used to reveal hard coded string elements https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/strings
4. Based on the information, I now knew what I need to do in the exercise. I ran the program with the command "strings passtr"
5. After that the output of the command was as follows:
   * <img width="804" height="485" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4435ac75-3d67-45c0-818e-2ee970695465" />
   * From here I saw that there is a flag and above the flag a password called "sala-hakkeri-321".
6. I went ahead and inputted the password, the password was the correct one

# b) Make a new version of the passtr.c program where the password doesn't appear directly as-is in the binary. Demonstrate with a test that the password doesn't appear. (Obfuscation is sufficient.)

* I was pretty lost in this exercise, as this is the first time I had touched c#. I watched a quick tutorial by some Indian guy on how to encrypt strings https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lexb9VFCPM
* First I tried to encrpyt the "sala-hakkeri-321" inside the passtr.c, quite quickly i realised that that is the incorrect way to do it, the correct way would be to first encrpyt the password in a seperate script, then use that encrpyted as a string in my code
* Following the tutorial I created a encrpytion script outside of the main script that will produce me some gibberish

* #include <stdio.h>
* #include <string.h>

* void encrypt(char password[], int key) {
*    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(password); i++)
*        password[i] = password[i] - key;
*}

*int main() {
*    char test[] = "sala-hakkeri-321";
*    encrypt(test, 0xAED);
*    printf("%s\n", test);
*    return 0;
*}
* I compiled the script and outputted the encrypt.c to the compiled version of just encrypt
* I ran the compiled version and got some gibberish as the output

* Now i inputted the gibberish to a char string variable

* Compiled the c code to an executable and executed it.

* The password is not shown anymore when i run string <file>

I tested the password myself, it seems to work. I am not sure if this is a correct way to do things but atleast I managed to solve the exercise.

I guess the more elegant way to do this is to decrypt it before shown to user? Also encrypt the user input so that it will match the string?

# c) Packd. Run 'packd' from the package ezbin-challenges.zip. What is the password? What is the flag? (This task is slightly more challenging. Write down the approaches you tried and hypotheses you came up with. Hopefully you'll reach the goal yourself, but if not, the walkthrough will be revealed in class...)

I did the same steps as before, so downloading zip etc and ran strings

<img width="1281" height="597" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/600d4acc-e63f-4ed2-9045-d3772494ccfc" />

Found the flag, relatively easy but now I need to find out how to acutally get the password. This time it was not as simple as taking the string that is below the "Whats the password?", but I can assume that following the last logic it is probably now decrypted with something. piilos-An, I suppose this exercise needs me to reverse engineer the encryption that is being used, re create the encrpytion and then decrypt it so that i can get the password. 

Something else that was interesting was the fact that there was some metadata for this file. "This file is packed with the UPX executable packer http://upx.sf.net $"

Also there is a directory /proc/self/exe, Debian 12,DYNIC, GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABL, PROT_EXEC|PROT_WRITE failed. These were all detected using the strings packd.

So following the crumb trail I started by investingating what is UPX. It is a packageing tool similar to 7-ZIP https://upx.github.io/
